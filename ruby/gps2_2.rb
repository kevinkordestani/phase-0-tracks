# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # create method that takes Parameter 
  # takes parameter and use split method to seperate items 
  # create a hash variable 
  # iterate through the array and pass into hash variable using .each 
  # set default quantity equal to 1 
  # print the list to the console [can you use one of your other methods here?]
# output: hash 

# variable list to store the hash

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: create method that takes item name and quantity  
# steps: push that item name and quantity into the hash variable 
# 
# output: updated hash 

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: create method that removes item, takes item as parameter
# steps: remove item from list 
# output: updated hash 

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: create method that takes item name and quantity as parameter
# steps: once item and quantity is passed it will seach for item and update
# output: updated hash 

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: method that prints hash 
# steps: iterate through hash to print out each line with item and quantity
# output: current list looking pretty

#Release 5 

	# I learned that pseudocode helps orginize our thoughts better so that it is easier to write our code
	# Hashes worked best with this challenge because we had a key/value pair, where the item was the key and quantity was the value
		#It would have been more challenging using an array. 
	# A method returns the value of its last line 
	# I guess you can pass a lot of things into methods as arguments. We passed strings, integers, hashes (which prob means you can pass an array as well).
	# I learned that I can use a methods output and pass that as an argument into another method
	# I still had some troube with printing and output
